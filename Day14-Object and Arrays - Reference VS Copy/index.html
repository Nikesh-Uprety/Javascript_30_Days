    // let age="100";
    // let age1=age;
    // console.log(age,age1);
    // age="300";
    // console.log(age,age1);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];


    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[2]='niku';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice()
    // console.log(team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Niku Bo(_)s',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain= person;
    // captain.number =99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age:12});
    // console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person} // object spread 
    // console.log(captain3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const nikuhandle= {
        name: 'niku',

            facebook:'Nikesh-Uprety',
            instagram:'@nikesh_up'
        }
    }
    console.log(nikuhandle);

    const copyniku = Object.assign({},nikuhandle) // This fails while deep clone

    // So here is the cheap way of doing that poor man deep clone!

    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(nikuhandle));
    console.log(dev);
